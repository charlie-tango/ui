# Visually Hidden

If you just set `display: none;` or `[hidden]` on elements, it will prevent it from being found by
screen readers. Instead hide the content with styling, but keep it readable for screen readers. Read
[how to hide content](https://a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/) for more insights.

## Usage

```jsx harmony
import { VisuallyHidden } from '@charlietango/ui';

const Example = () => <VisuallyHidden>This text can still be found</VisuallyHidden>;
```

It intentionally doesn't expose any of the normal `<Box />` properties, since you shouldn't need to
to style it further.
