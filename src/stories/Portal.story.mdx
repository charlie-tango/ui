# Portal

> Read the [Portals documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) on React for more details

The `<Portal />` component allows you to render an element at the root the website, by creating a
new container element and rendering the content using `createPortal`. This is useful as the basis
for other components like a Modal.

The containing `<div>` has no styling attached to it. You can identify it by the `data-portal`
attribute, that will have the value of the `id` you supplied (or an empty string).

## Usage

```jsx harmony
const Example = () => {
  return (
    <Portal>
      <Text>
        This is the content inside the Portal that's mounted at the root of the document container.
      </Text>
    </Portal>
  );
};
```

<Portal>
  <Box
    sx={{
      border: '1px solid black',
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 3,
      right: 3,
      left: [3, '50%'],
      bg: '#f4f4f4',
    }}
    p={3}
  >
    <Text>
      This is the content inside the Portal that's mounted at the root of the document container.
    </Text>
  </Box>
</Portal>
