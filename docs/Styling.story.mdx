# Styling

## `sx`

One of the concepts implemented in [rebass](https://rebassjs.org/) is the `sx` prop. This allows you
to define a CSS styles object on all `<Box>` components, that can consume the `theme` values. This
is really useful for defining responsive styles using the `[]` syntax.

```jsx harmony
import { Box } from '@charlietango/ui';

const Example = () => (
  <Box
    sx={{
      color: 'red',
      px: [3, 6],
    }}
  />
);
```

Under the hood, this is using [@styled-system/css](https://styled-system.com/css) to convert the
`sx` prop into styles.

### Using `sx` with `css`

By running [emotion](https://www.emotion.sh/) through Babel you can use the `css` prop - the allows
you to write the tagged template or Object styling directly on the components. It's then converted
into a style and `className` by Babel.

If we combine [@styled-system/css](https://styled-system.com/css) with the `css` prop, we can
actually replicate the `sx` prop on any element, so we still have access to the theme and responsive
values.

```jsx harmony
import { sx } from '@charlietango/ui';

const Example = () => (
  <div
    css={sx({
      color: 'red',
      px: [3, 6],
    })}
  />
);
```

## Base CSS

The library includes a `<BaseCss />` Global styles file - It's built on top of
[sanitize.css](https://github.com/csstools/sanitize.css), with some of our settings included.

```typescript jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming';
import { BaseCss, baseTheme } from '@charlietango/ui';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={baseTheme}>
    <BaseCss />
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

In addition to this, it also extracts a few values (if set) from the theme, and defines as global
defaults.

```css
html {
  background-color: 'theme.colors.background';
  color: 'theme.colors.text';
  font-family: 'theme.fonts.body';
}
```
